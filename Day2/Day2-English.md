# Second Day

## What did I do today?
Today, I reviewed the concepts learned the day before, solved some proposed exercises and restructured my journey.

## Exercises solved
1. **Exercises with Variables and Primitive Types**:
   - Create variables of each primitive type and initialize them with values. Then print these values ​​to the screen.
   - Write a program that exchanges the values ​​stored in two variables and prints the values ​​before and after the exchange.

2. **Operator Exercises**:
   - Create a program that reads two integers and prints the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus.
   - Implement a program that calculates BMI (Body Mass Index) using arithmetic operators.

3. **Flow Control Exercises**:
   - Write a program that checks whether a number is even or odd.
   - Create a program that, given a year, determines whether it is a leap year.

4. **Exercises with Loops and Arrays**:
   - Make a program that reads 10 user numbers, stores them in an array and prints the largest and smallest values.
   - Write a program that prints the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci series.

5. **Methods and Classes Exercises**:
   - Create a `Car` class with methods to accelerate, brake and display the current speed.
   - Implement a `Calculator` class with static methods for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

6. **Inheritance and Polymorphism Exercises**:
   - Create a base class `Animal` with a method `emitSound()`. Derive classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, etc., that override this method.
   - Develop a simple `Shape` system where `Shape` is a base class with a `calcularArea()` method, and derived classes such as `Circle`, `Rectangle` implement this method.

7. **Interface and Polymorphism Exercises**:
   - Create a `FormaGeometrica` interface with a `calcularArea` method. Implement this interface in classes such as `Circle`, `Square`, `Rectangle`.

8. **Exercises with Exceptions**:
   - Write a method that throws a custom exception when a negative number is passed and catches that exception in a `try-catch` block.
   - Implement a program that handles multiple exceptions, such as `NumberFormatException` and `ArithmeticException`.

9. **Exercises with Streams and Lambda**:
   - Use streams to filter a list of strings, keeping only those that start with a specific letter.
   - Write a program that uses lambda expressions to sort a list of names in reverse alphabetical order.
